# Digit-Recognizer    

This repository provides an implementation to the Digit Recognizer competition on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer).    

We use deep learning to complete the task of classification of digits, and achieve an accuracy of 99.51% on the Kaggle test set.    

The layers used include convolutional neural networks (CNN), dense networks, max-pooling and batch-normlization.    

In addition, we also employ gridsearch to look for optimal parameter configurations.
